# Flutter Movie Ticket

Flutter Movie Ticket is a Flutter-based application designed to provide up-to-date information about both currently playing and upcoming movies. This app utilizes the TMDB API (The Movie Database API) to present movie data such as synopses, reviews, genres, posters, and other detailed information. With a modern and intuitive interface, users can easily browse through popular movie listings, explore genre categories, or view detailed information about films that catch their interest.

This application is designed to help movie enthusiasts stay up-to-date with the world of cinema. Without ticket booking or watchlist features, Flutter Movie Ticket focuses on providing a simple yet informative movie exploration experience. With data continuously updated in real-time via the TMDB API, users can enjoy fast, accurate, and easily accessible service at any time.
