# Flutter Movie App

Flutter Movie App is a Flutter-based application designed to provide up-to-date information about both movies and TV series, including currently playing and upcoming releases. This app utilizes the TMDB API (The Movie Database API) to present detailed data such as synopses, reviews, genres, posters, and other essential information. With a modern and user-friendly interface, users can easily browse through popular movies and TV series, explore genre categories, or view detailed insights about their favorites.

This application is ideal for movie and TV series enthusiasts who want to stay updated with the latest entertainment content. By focusing on providing a seamless exploration experience without features like ticket booking or watchlists, Flutter Movie App delivers real-time, accurate, and fast data updates directly via the TMDB API. Whether you're a fan of cinema or television, this app ensures you always have the latest information at your fingertips.
